Great set of KPIs! Here's how to calculate and plot each one in Power BI:

1. Absence Rate (%) by Department
Calculation:

Formula: (Total Days Lost to Sickness / (Total Employees × Working Days in the Period)) × 100
Steps:
Create a measure for total days lost to sickness.
Create a measure for total working days (e.g., Total Employees × Working Days in the Period).
Create a KPI measure for Absence Rate using the formula above.
Plotting:

Use a Bar Chart or Column Chart to show Absence Rate by Department.
Configure the X-axis with Department Name and Y-axis with the Absence Rate KPI.
2. Cost of Absenteeism
Calculation:

Formula: Sum(Salary Cost of Days Lost Due to Sickness)
Steps:
Create a measure for the salary cost associated with sickness absence.
Sum this measure across departments or periods.
Plotting:

Use a Bar Chart or Column Chart to visualize the cost of absenteeism by Department or Month.
Alternatively, use a Pie Chart to show the distribution of costs by department.
3. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Impact of Absences
Calculation:

Formula: Total Absence Days / Average Working Days per Employee
Steps:
Create a measure for total absence days.
Determine the average number of working days for full-time employees.
Calculate the FTE impact using the formula above.
Plotting:

Use a Bar Chart to display FTE Impact by Department or Month.
Configure the X-axis with Department Name or Month and Y-axis with the FTE Impact measure.
4. Absence Trends by Month and Season
Calculation:

Formula: Aggregate monthly or seasonal absence data.
Steps:
Create a measure for total absence days by month or season.
Aggregate the data by month or season.
Plotting:

Use a Line Chart or Area Chart to show trends over time.
Configure the X-axis with Date/Month/Season and Y-axis with Total Absence Days.
5. Sickness Absence Resolution Time
Calculation:

Formula: Average(Time from Submission to Resolution)
Steps:
Create a measure for the time taken to resolve each absence request.
Calculate the average resolution time.
Plotting:

Use a Line Chart or Bar Chart to display the average resolution time.
Configure the X-axis with Date or Department and Y-axis with the Average Resolution Time measure.
Implementing in Power BI
Add New Measures: Use DAX formulas to create measures for each KPI.
Create Visuals: Use the corresponding charts or graphs for each KPI. Drag and drop the relevant measures into the values area and configure the axes and filters as needed.
Add Slicers: To allow users to filter data by department, month, or other relevant criteria.
Let me know if you need any help with the DAX formulas or setting up the visuals!
